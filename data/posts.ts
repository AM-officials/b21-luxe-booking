The monsoon season brings relief from the scorching heat, but it also presents unique challenges for your skin. High humidity, sudden temperature changes, and increased pollution can wreak havoc on your complexion.

## Common Monsoon Skin Issues

### 1. Excess Oil Production
The humidity can trigger your sebaceous glands to produce more oil, leading to:
- Clogged pores
- Breakouts
- Shiny T-zone

### 2. Fungal Infections
The damp environment is perfect for bacterial and fungal growth, especially in areas where skin folds.

## Your Monsoon Skincare Routine

### Morning Routine
1. **Gentle Cleanser**: Use a pH-balanced cleanser to remove overnight buildup
2. **Toner**: Apply an alcohol-free toner to balance your skin's pH
3. **Lightweight Moisturizer**: Opt for gel-based moisturizers
4. **Sunscreen**: Never skip SPF, even on cloudy days

### Evening Routine
1. **Double Cleanse**: Remove makeup and pollutants thoroughly
2. **Exfoliate**: Use gentle exfoliation 2-3 times a week
3. **Serum**: Apply vitamin C or niacinamide serums
4. **Night Moisturizer**: Use a slightly richer formula for overnight repair

## Professional Treatments at B21

Our expert estheticians recommend:
- **Deep Cleansing Facials**: Remove impurities and unclog pores
- **Chemical Peels**: Gentle exfoliation for smoother skin
- **Hydrating Treatments**: Maintain optimal moisture levels

### Gentle Cleansing
Adjust your washing routine:
- **Reduce Frequency**: Wash 2-3 times per week instead of daily

- **Lukewarm Water**: Hot water strips natural oils

### Protective Styling
Shield your hair from the elements:
